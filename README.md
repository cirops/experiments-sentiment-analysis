## Experiments with Sentiment Analysis on the MERLOT dataset

This project aims to experiment with a number of pre-processors, vectorizers, classifiers and their respective parameters/hyperparameters, so that we can get a better understand both of the more "classical" classifiers, as well the inherent capability of the dataset.

Vectorizing:
    - Count Vectorizer
    - TF-IDF

Parameters:
    - Stop-words
    - Max Features
    - N-grams 

Classifiers:
    - Na√Øve Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Support Vector Machine

Possible Refinements:
    - Over/Undersampling;
    - Stemming/Lemmatizing of the dataset
